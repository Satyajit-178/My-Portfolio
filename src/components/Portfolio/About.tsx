            I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user

            work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences 
            that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.

            In my spare time, I'm usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my family, 
            or exploring new technologies and contributing to open source projects.
